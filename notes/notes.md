Brief update (Aug06): 
- Side note: James popped back after 9:45pm tues night. And he gave some comments on the sprint 1 report. He still insisted on the visualization part of the project. But overall we are doing fine. He also promised to give gradings on previous submission by the weekend.

So, in order to do visualization/dashboard, I've decided that writing an DASH App is inevitable. So, I am convert the juypter notebook code into DASH yesterday and today. I've converted 20% of the graphs from juypter notebook as far. Once the code are converted, it will be easier to piece together on a page to form an app.

Hopefully, I can get those setup just like the previous DASH project that we can show via Google Cloud.
